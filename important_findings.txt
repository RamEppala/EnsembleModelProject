Machine Learning Project on Ensemble Modeling

Aim is to build ensemble model to improve the accuracy of the model.

1.Data Exploration

For this project, I taken the data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository

load the data into R and look at it closely.

2. Data Cleaning

Let’s check for missing values. Impute missing values with median.

3. I have divided the data into two parts which I’ll be using to simulate the training and testing operations. 

4. training a random forest and test its accuracy on the test set.

0.81 accuracy with the individual random forest model.

5.Training the knn model.

0.86 accuracy with the individual KNN model.

6.Training the Logistic regression model
logistic regression also gives us the accuracy of 0.86

7.tried out different ways of forming an ensemble with these models 

8.tried applying logistic regression and GBM as top layer models with the following steps.

1.Train the individual base layer models on training data.

2.Predict using each base layer model for training data and test data.

3.Now train the top layer model again on the predictions of the bottom layer models that has been made on the training data.

4.Finally, predict using the top layer model with the predictions of bottom layer models that has been made for testing data.
