# EnsembleModelProject
Project name: Machine Learning Project on Ensemble modeling
Description:This project is to build ensemble model to improve the accuracy of model. This project will demonstrate how to make the model more robust and stable thus ensuring decent performance on the test cases in most scenarios.You can use ensembling to capture linear and simple as well non-linear complex relationships in the data. This can be done by using two different models and forming an ensemble of two.
Table of Contents: types of emsembling: Averaging,Majority Vote,Weighted Average. Algorithms used for stop layer model are GBM, Logistic Regression, for bottom layer models are Random Forest, KNN,Logistic Regression.
Installation: 1. download R it is opensource 2. open R studio and upload imbalancedproject folder.
Prerequisites: An Intel-compatible platform running Windows 2000, XP/2003/Vista/7/8/2012 Server/8.1/10.
At least 32 MB of RAM, a mouse, and enough disk space for recovered files, image files, etc.
The administrative privileges are required to install and run R-Studio utilities under Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/7/8/2012 Server/8.1/10.
A network connection for data recovering over network.
Installing R under Windows:
The bin/windows directory of a CRAN site contains binaries for a base distribution and a large number of add-on packages from CRAN to run on 32- or 64-bit Windows (Windows 7 and later are tested; XP is known to fail some tests) on ‘ix86’ and ‘x86_64’ CPUs.
Your file system must allow long file names (as is likely except perhaps for some network-mounted systems). If it doesn’t also support conversion to short name equivalents (a.k.a. DOS 8.3 names), then R must be installed in a path that does not contain spaces.
Installation is via the installer R-3.4.3-win.exe. Just double-click on the icon and follow the instructions. When installing on a 64-bit version of Windows the options will include 32- or 64-bit versions of R (and the default is to install both). You can uninstall R from the Control Panel.
Note that you will be asked to choose a language for installation, and that choice applies to both installation and un-installation but not to running R itself.
